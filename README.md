## Changes in WS3

### New Components
1. Rules
    * IRules

    * YatzyRules
    * GameType
2. Categories
    * Category
    * CategoryYahtzee

3. Factory
4. IDieObserver

Naming of files in folder Database is named based on game type, i.e. Yatzy or Yahtzee, which also enables correct viewing and resuming at application start. 

#### Factory Pattern
Factory creates rules and categories based on selected user choice, regarding Yahtzee or Yatzy game type. 

#### Observer Pattern
IDieObserver distributes rolled die events from CollectionOfDie to ViewController which in turn calls for rendering methods in RoundView.
